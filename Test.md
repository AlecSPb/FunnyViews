# FunnyViews

## [中文](https://blog.csdn.net/samlss/article/details/81189576)<br>

**Inspired by everyday life, programming is also. <br/><br/>
When i find some interesting views in the daily life, i will record and code them down.<br/><br/>
A lot of funny views in android, include loading view, progress view, and so on, and i will continue to develop.
When i constructing these views, i didn't use any picture data, and i am using Android's native api to paint them.<br/><br/>
If you have any funny idea, you can contact me 729717222@qq.com:cupid:**
