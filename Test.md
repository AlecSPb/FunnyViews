# ClockViews
Inspired by everyday life, programming is also.

When i find some interesting views in the daily life, i will record and code them down.

A lot of funny views in android, include loading view, progress view, and so on, and i will continue to develop.

When i constructing these views, i didn't use any picture data, and i am using Android's native api to paint them.

If you have any funny idea, you can contact me 729717222@qq.comðŸ’˜
